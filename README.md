# RPG

A 2D game written in Go, using the [engo](https://www.github.com/EngoEngine/engo)
engine.

## Design

Inspired by
[Castle of the Winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_the_Winds): an
orthogonal tile-based RPG in which the game advances when the player moves. There
are no animations or sound effects.
