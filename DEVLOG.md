Continuing work on Milestone 3. Working on satisfying `errcheck`, which doesn't
like `AddOccuptant()` or `preloadMapAssets` usage. Then the actual work begins
on HUD, AI, and Walls.

Engo has recently hit v1.0, and I'm returning to this project after
a two-year hiatus. Coming into the repo with a fresh perspective, I
plan to do the following:

- Migrate from Glide to Dep
- Upgrade Engo to v1.0
- Finish the core game loop and eliminate serious bugs
- Add sufficient unit tests
