Engo has recently hit v1.0, and I'm returning to this project after
a two-year hiatus. Coming into the repo with a fresh perspective, I
plan to do the following:

- [done] Migrate from Glide to Dep
- [done] Upgrade Engo to v1.0
- Finish the core game loop and eliminate serious bugs
- Add sufficient unit tests
