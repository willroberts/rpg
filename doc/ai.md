# Enemy AI

- When a turn is processed:
	- Enemies check to see if the Player is within VisionRadius grid cells
	- If the Enemy "sees" the Player, Enemy moves towards the Player
	- If the Enemy has a ranged ability, Enemy attacks the Player
	- Enemies might Flee from the Player - based on STR?
	- When injured, Enemies might Heal themselves
